This Random Quote Generator generates random quotes.

# Random-Quote-Generator
Practice using fetch

The app.js file generate quotes by hard-code quotes into an array, then generate random quotes
The index.js file generate quotes by fetching data from an API

Lesson learned:
1. always Inspect => go to Console Tab to see why code does not run as expected
2. do not have to import fetch from node-fetch if relating to browser
